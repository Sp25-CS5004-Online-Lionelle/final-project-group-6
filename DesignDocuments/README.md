# Design Documents

You may have multiple design documents for this project. Place them all in this folder. File naming is up to you, but it should be clear what the document is about. At the bare minimum, you will want a pre/post UML diagram for the project. 

# Inital Design/Project Proposal

What are you building?
- Our group is building an application that provides information about Nation Parks using the National Park Services API.

What are the initial features for the application?
- Java Swing/AWT desktop application
- Displays a list of all national parks
- show basic park information (name, location, description)
- Scolling navigation
- Create custom park list by zipcode / state code
- add/remove parks from lists
- save list in various formats (JSON/xml/csv)
- Fetching data from National Park Services API

What are the minimum additional features you plan to implement?
- Display park images
- basic image agllery view
- basic error handling
- load save list/ edit existing list/filter list/result
- generate random park suggestion
- quick "view all parks" button
- basic filtering options

What are your stretch goals (features beyond the minimum)?


Go over your initial design.
Special emphasis should be placed on how you plan to break it up
MVC, presenter, file management, different input validation, testing, documentation, etc.

How do you plan to break up the work?
- Similar to how we broke up the work for the initial project proposal.
- Split the work by mapping out the main components and splitting it up by who wants to do what.
- Usage of GitHub Projects to keep track of who is doing what.
