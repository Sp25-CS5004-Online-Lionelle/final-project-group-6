## Application Name and Description
- The application name and a brief description of the application

Our Application name is National Park Explorer. 
Utilizing a national park API our group was able to construct a program that allows the user to search for national parks based on various factors such as Zipcode, Name, State. Using these searches the user is then able to manipulate the results by using the various buttons to either add and remove parks from a list, save all the search results, generate a random park, view the details of said park, filter activities, etc.
